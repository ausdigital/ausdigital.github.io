# AusDigital Digital Capability Publisher (DCP) 1.0 Specification

## Introduction

This document describes a standard service for discovering the integration surface of a
participant in RESTful business-to-business message exchange.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council e-Invoicing
initiative, and is under active development at http://ausdigital.org/.


## Goals

The primary goal of the Digital Capability Publisher (DCP) 1.0 Specification is to TBA.

The Digital Capability Publisher (DCP) 1.0 Specification defines TBA.


## Status

This spec is an early draft for consuiltation.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council
[eInvoicing initiative](http://ausdigital.org), and is under active
development at
[https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp).

Comments and feedback are encouraged and welcome. Pull requests with improvements are welcome too.


## Glossary

Phrase | Definition
------------ | -------------
ausdigital-dcp/1 | This specification.
ausdigital-dcl/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigtial [Digital Capability Locator (DCL)](https://ausdigital-dcl.readthedocs.io) specification
ausdigital-idp/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Identity Provider (IDP)](https://ausdigital-idp.readthedocs.io) specification.
ausdigital-tap/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Transaction Access Point(TAP)](http://ausdigital.org/transaction-access-point) specification.
ausdigital-tap/2 | Version 2 of the AusDigital [Transaction Access Point(TAP)](http://ausdigital.org/transaction-access-point) specification.
ausdigital-nry/1 | Version 1 of the AusDigital [Notary (NRY)](http://ausdigital.org/notary/) specification.

The DCP service depends on `ausdigital-dcl/1` and `ausdigital-idp/1`.

Other `ausdigital-tap` and `ausdigital-nry` services both depend on the DCP service.

RFC 2119.


## Application Programming Interface

Implementations MUST provide a compliant REST Application Programming Interface.

A draft [REST interface v1.0](https://swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp/1.0) is available for comment.

## Protocol

For open B2B standards to be adopted, users must have confidence in the integrity:

 - confidence in business identity.
 - common business semantics.
 - dynamic service discovery.

This framework operates on the basis that the issuer of a business identifier is best positioned to verify the identity of anyone attempting to authorise an update to the metadata registry. That is why for example we are proposing the ausdigital-dcl/1 for the Australian Business Number (ABN) should be operated by the Australian Business Register (ABR).

The Digital Capability Publisher is functionally equivalent to a REST version of the European OASIS standard "Service Metadata Publisher". Users are expected to have used the ausdigital-dcl/1 to discover the appropriate DCP service for a particular business. They then interact with the DCP using the REST protocol [documented here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/api/ausdigital/ausdigital-dcp/1.0) to access a collection of ServiceMetaData entries for the business. 

The sample below shows a service metadata record example for a business with ABN 23601120601 that supports both standard invoice and RCTI processes.

```
    {"ServiceMetadata":[{
      "ParticipantIdentifier": {"scheme": "abn", "value": "23601120601"},

          "EndpointURI": "https://api.myob.com/au/essentials/businesses/23601120601/purchase/invoice-1",
          "RequireBusinessLevelSignature": "true",
          "MinimumAuthenticationLevel": "2",
          "ServiceActivationDate": "2015-05-01",

          {

          "ServiceDescription": "invoice service",

        }]
      },

    },
    {... another signed service metadata structure ...
