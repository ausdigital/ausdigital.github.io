# Billing Process

## Invoice Document Profiles

 The Invoice document is used in six different process contexts, indicated using the UBL ProfileID.

 * Standard invoice from seller to buyer ("ProfileID":"dbc:invoice")
 * Updated standard invoice from seller to buyer that replaces a pervious invoice of the same ID ("ProfileID":"dbc:adjustment")
 * Recipient created tax invoice from buyer to seller ("ProfileID":"dbc:rcti")
 * Tax receipt sent from seller to buyer after payment has been made - usually for POS or online purchases ("ProfileID":"dbc:taxreceipt")
 * Credit note sent from seller to buyer that references an earlier standard invoice ("ProfileID":"dbc:creditnote")
 * Debiit note sent from buyer to seller that references an earlier RCTI ("ProfileID":"dbc:debitnote")

The detailed business vlaidation rules for each invoice profile are defined in [Validation Rules](#validation-rules).

## Document Response Codes

A UBL document response provides a means for the receiver party to update the sender on the processing state of the invoice.  The set of valid document response codes depends on the business process identified by the ProcessID (which is the same as the customizationID in UBL instances) are

 * Acknowledged - confirms receipt of the invoice (but does not imply approval to pay).
 * Approved - means that the payer has approved the invoice for (future) payment in accordance with payment terms.
 * Disputed - means that the payer has not accepted the inovice and will dispute some or all of the invoice.
 * Rejected - means that the payer has rejected the entire invoice and will not be paying.  

## State Lifecycle

The diagram shows the allowed set of states for an invoice as understood by both parties in the collaborative process.  Every transition from one state to another is triggered by the echange of a business message - which could be either an invoice (one of six profiles) or a response document (with one of four response codes).

![Billing State Lifecycle](Billing-StateLifecycle.png)

 * The TaxReceipt has the simplest lifecycle because it is just a record of a previous payment and so there is only a single invoice (profileID=taxreceipt) sent from seller to buyer and the state is "paid".  No document response needed.
 * The receipt of an RCTI (profileID=rcti) by a seller from a buyer takes the state directly to "approved" because this is a payer initiated transaction.  However the payer may subsequently send an invoice (profileID=debitnote) to make an adjustment to the rcti prior to eventual payment is accordance with payment terms.
 * The standard inovice that is a demand for future payment from seller to buyer is the most complex lifecycle becuase there can be 
  - various response documents indicating buyer processing status (acknowledged, approved, disputed, rejected)
  - a re-issue of the invoice with changes (profileID = adjustment) from seller to buyer - usually in response to a disputed status.
  - an issue of a credit note against an existing invoice (profileID = creditnote) - also usually in response to a disputed status.
  - an outright rejection of the invoice by the buyer which leads to a cancelled end-state.
 * The "success" end state in all cases is "paid" - indicated by the receipt of a payment record from a bank reconcilation file (outside of the scope of this specificaiton).

# UBL Syntax 1.0 Billing Document Specifications

The billing process is supported by the invoice document (six variants) and the response document (four status codes) as described in the [billing process](#billing-process) model.  This section specifies the required invoice and response document models.

## Invoice Document

Is defined by the DBC [CoreInvoice XML Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/spec/maindoc/CoreInvoice-1.0.xsd) library.

 * **[Invoice Samples](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/tree/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/samples/Invoice/)**

## Response Document

Is defined by the DBC [Document Response XML Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/spec/maindoc/Response-1.0.xsd) library.

 * **[Response Sample](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/samples/Response/SampleResponse-ConformantResponse.xml)**

The response document is a generic structure for all UBL document responses.  The generic response becomes a meaningful invoice response via the correct population of two key fields:
 * "profileID" which MUST be one of the 6 invoice profiles define in the [billing process](#invoice-document-profiles)
 * "statusReasonCode" which MUST contain one of the 4 values defined in the [invoice response codes](#document-response-codes) 
 

# UBL Syntax 2.0 Billing Document Specifications

The billing process is supported by the invoice document (six variants) and the response document (four status codes) as described in the [billing process](#billing-process) model.  This page specifies the required invoice and response document models.

## Invoice Document

Is defined by the [Invoice Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/spec/Invoice.json) which is a simple single root JSON Schema that is a semantically equivalent representation of the DBC [CoreInvoice XML Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/spec/maindoc/CoreInvoice-1.0.xsd) library.

 * **[Browsable Invoice Schema](http://ausdigital.org/docson.html#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/spec/Invoice.json)**
 * **[Invoice Samples](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/tree/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/samples/Invoice/)**

## Response Document

Is defined by the [Response Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/spec/Response.json) which is a simple single root JSON Schema that is a semantically equivalent representation of the DBC [Document Response XML Schema](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/1.0/spec/maindoc/Response-1.0.xsd) library.

 * **[Browsable Response Schema](http://ausdigital.org/docson.html#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/spec/Response.json)**
 * **[Response Sample](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-bill/blob/master/resources/ausdigital-syn/2.0/samples/Response/SampleResponse-ConformantResponse.json)**

The response document is a generic structure for all UBL document responses.  The generic response becomes a meaningful invoice response via the correct population of two key fields:

 * "profileID" which MUST be one of the 6 invoice profiles define in the [invoice document profiles](#invoice-document-profiles)
 * "statusReasonCode" which MUST contain one of the 4 values defined in the [invoice response codes](#document-response-codes)
